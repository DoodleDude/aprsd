Autorisation/Authentication
---------------------------

* How can we extend this in a plugin. 
      
* Extend login/user support. Individidual users + groups (roles) + permissions. 
  (maybe some of this should be implemented in db plugin, but need some
   core support here). 
  
* Re-consider SAR-mode. Allow multiple SAR-modes for different missions. 
  Assign users/groups/roles to SAR-missions. Configure SAR-missions like
  views to control how things are displayed (filters, etc). Consider assigning 
  aliases per SAR-mission instead of globally. Allow a SAR mode to activate 
  a particular (pre-defined) data source? 
  
       
      
Iframe/API
----------

* Consider how to add API extensions from plugins
* Add: Get trace from database
* Subscription: Info about a particular station/objects.
* Subscription: Misc. events from map view. 
* Consider security/login

----------------
    
* Flexible Gate for routing packets to and between channels? igate --> router
    - Router specification? Router framework?
    - Allow translation between protocols? Pluggable modules.

  Separate plugin?
