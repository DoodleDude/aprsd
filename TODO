       IN PROGRESS        
        
* Callback (API) to notify plugins about setting alias/icon.

   - Rubber zoom that crosses dateline results in trouble. 

* Document and simplify translation ?

* Consider moving country-specific (statkart, met.no, etc) stuff to separate plugin.

     - Basic tagging. DONE.
     - Simple UI. DONE.
     - Tags in filterscripts. DONE.
     - Set tags in AIS plugin. DONE.

* Revise filter scripting. 
     - Consider use /* */ for comments instead of #? And # for tags. 
     - Consider rules to set tags. Tag ontology? Separate script or same file as filters?  
     - Consider positive rules, not just negative rules. 
     - Cleaner syntax? 
     - Additional actions? Icon selection? 
     - Document.

Autorisation/Authentication
---------------------------

* How can we extend this in a plugin. 
      
* Extend login/user support. Individidual users + groups (roles) + permissions. 
  (maybe some of this should be implemented in db plugin, but need some
   core support here). 
  
* Re-consider SAR-mode. Allow multiple SAR-modes for different missions. 
  Assign users/groups/roles to SAR-missions. Configure SAR-missions like
  views to control how things are displayed (filters, etc). Consider assigning 
  aliases per SAR-mission instead of globally. Allow a SAR mode to activate 
  a particular (pre-defined) data source? 
  
       
      
Iframe/API
----------

* Consider how to add API extensions from plugins
* Add: Get trace from database
* Subscription: Info about a particular station/objects.
* Subscription: Misc. events from map view. 
* Consider security/login



    
Channels/Sources
----------------
    
* Flexible Gate for routing packets to and between channels? igate --> router
    - Router specification? Router framework?
    - Allow translation between protocols? Pluggable modules. 

* Receive positions from clients (mobile app). This is both a source and a web-service?
  Separate plugin? 
     STARTED
  
* [C] Elevation profile from kartverket WPS? 




Other. 
-----

* Review how XML overlay works. Document it? Improvements? 

* Import from GPX files (to layers?)

* App: Autodiscovery of servers on local network

* APRS messaging - a plugin? 
    
* Additions to search function?
