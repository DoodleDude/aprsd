V.1.3 (may or june 2013)
------------------------
     
* [M] Better styling of forms for mobile. Consider JQuery mobile.

* Too easy to lock yourself out when changing users regex. Workaround?
  Prevent removing of 'admin' user by plugin?

Iframe API
----------
* Make links work in search lists
* Subscribe to asynchronous updates (events/callbacks)
* Subscription: Objects in map view.
* Subscription: Info about a particular station/objects.
* Subscription: Misc. events from map view. 
* Consider how to add API extensions from plugins
* Consider security/login





Configuration support
---------------------
     
* Consider per-use reading of parameters
     
* Look at httpd/ServerBase.java: Can some config parameters be made static
  to reduce redundant storage when there are multiple instances? 

* Make channel classes and other relevant classes implement 
  ManagedObject interface. Support re-load without needing to 
  restart server.
    


    
Channels/Sources
----------------

* Filters based on getSource. Experiment.  

* Access control and visibility to clients
     
* Channel code in separate subpackage / subdirectory: 
    - Move out Channel, InetChannel, TncChannel and DupCheck. 
    - Rename Channel to ChannelBase
    - Channel interface in core
    
* Flexible Gate for routing packets to and between channels? igate --> router
    - Router specification? Router framework?
    - Allow translation between protocols? Pluggable modules. 

* Soundmodem plugin
     STARTED.

* AIS plugin

* Receive positions from clients (mobile app). This is both a source and a web-service?
  Separate plugin? 
     STARTED

Other. 
-----

* Import from GPX files (to layers?)

* App: Autodiscovery of servers on local network

* Messaging - a plugin? 

* Allow objects with certain attributes (like source, callsign) to 
  be visible only for logged in users. Note: Should this be part of a filter framework?
      STARTED

* Change class hierarchy to support other types of position objects, 
  not just plain APRS. 
      STARTED.
    
* Additions to search function?
  
* Permissions (objects, other)? Sender id? Consider simple user profile support? 

* More configurable view profiles?  Filter framework? Scripting?
