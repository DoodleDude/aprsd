--------------------------
Preparations for V.2.0 M.0
Version 1.1, etc. 
--------------------------

 
Web Server
----------
 
* Replace HTTP server (efficiency, extensibility). The "Simple 
  framework" http://www.simpleframework.org can be a good candidate. 
     DONE. 

* Use Apache for all static files. 
     DONE.
     
* Simplify webserver impl. (esp. Scala part). 
 
* Make it RESTful? Use RESTlets? It is fundamentally restful already, 
  but uses POST method. 


API, Extensibility
------------------

* [C] Javascript external API at client side.
* [C] Javascript plugin arch/API at client side.

* Component API, add components in config.
      DONE. 

* Framework for web-interface extensions in Scala. 

* Jar files in a subdirectory - easier to add extra components
      DONE.

* History.Item as standalone class



Database
--------

* Database setup. Collect simple update events in a database. 
       DONE.
       
* Can this be a plugin module? Database stuff should be completely optional in 1.1, 1.2
  etc.. (core database stuff will be part of core P.S. in later releases).
       DONE.
       
* Some experimentation in external programs/plugins? 
        
* Experimental search functionality/trails - but as external module? 
       DONE.


Other
-----

* [C] Some touch screen awareness to make it just a little 
      usable for mobile devices?
      
      STARTED (1.0b6) - mapped some touch events to mouse events.
      Can now pan map and zoom via buttons on top, but this is 
      slow on Ipad. Zoom gesture does not work yet. 

* Allow a dynamic number of data channels to be configured. 
  Not just two. 

* Allow objects with certain attributes (like input channel, callsign) to 
  be visible only for logged in users.  

* Change class hierarchy to support other types of position objects, 
  not just plain APRS. 
      STARTED.
  
* AIS objects and input channel.
    
* Additions to search function?
  
* Permissions (objects, other)? Sender id? Consider simple user profile support? 

* More configurable view profiles?  

* More flexible logging?

* Traffic load statistics (per station).
