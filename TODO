Configuration support
---------------------
     
* Consider per-use reading of parameters
     
* Look at httpd/ServerBase.java: Can some config parameters be made static
  to reduce redundant storage when there are multiple instances? 

* Make channel classes and other relevant classes implement 
  ManagedObject interface. Support re-load without needing to 
  restart server.
    


    
Channels/Sources
----------------

* Filters based on getSource. Experiment.  

* Access control and visibility to clients

    - Rename Channel to ChannelBase
    - Channel interface in core
    
* Flexible Gate for routing packets to and between channels? igate --> router
    - Router specification? Router framework?
    - Allow translation between protocols? Pluggable modules.
