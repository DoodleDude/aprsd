V.1.9 (october 2015), etc
--------------------------

* [C] Extend iframeAPI ....
       IN PROGRESS

* [C] Move API code out from menu.js to api.js
       IN PROGRESS        
        
* Callback (API) to notify plugins about setting alias/icon.
        
* Dateline wrapping problems: 
   - Rubber zoom that crosses dateline results in trouble. 

* Document and simplify translation ?

* Consider moving country-specific (statkart, met.no, etc) stuff to separate plugin.

* Add copyright info for LocalePlanet stuff
     
* Implement architecture for (semantic) tagging. Automatic tagging, user tagging.          

* Synchronisation protocol doesn't reconnect when parent is restarted? Check? Fix.



   
Autorisation/Authentication
---------------------------

* How can we extend this in a plugin. 
      
* Extend login/user support. Individidual users + groups (roles) + permissions. 
  (maybe some of this should be implemented in db plugin, but need some
   core support here). 
  
* Re-consider SAR-mode. Allow multiple SAR-modes for different missions. 
  Assign users/groups/roles to SAR-missions. Configure SAR-missions like
  views to control how things are displayed (filters, etc). Consider assigning 
  aliases per SAR-mission instead of globally. Allow a SAR mode to activate 
  a particular (pre-defined) data source? 
  
       
      
Iframe/API
----------

* Consider how to add API extensions from plugins
* Add: Get trace from database
* Subscription: Info about a particular station/objects.
* Subscription: Misc. events from map view. 
* Consider security/login



    
Channels/Sources
----------------
    
* Flexible Gate for routing packets to and between channels? igate --> router
    - Router specification? Router framework?
    - Allow translation between protocols? Pluggable modules. 

* Receive positions from clients (mobile app). This is both a source and a web-service?
  Separate plugin? 
     STARTED
  
* [C] Elevation profile from kartverket WPS? 




Other. 
-----

* Review how XML overlay works. Document it? Improvements? 

* Import from GPX files (to layers?)

* App: Autodiscovery of servers on local network

* APRS messaging - a plugin? 
    
* Additions to search function?
