VERSION 1.0
-----------

* Administrative interface. 
     STARTED (1.0b2)

* CSS cleanup. Alternative stylesheets for XML overlay?

* Code cleanups, stress test and performance tuning? 

* [C/S] Alternative trail lengths.

* [C] Sometimes last update in trail is missing. Fix?

* [C] Webkit (Google Chrome and Safari) issues??
      FIXED LOGIN issue (1.0b7) 


Preparations for V.2.0 M.0
--------------------------
 
* Replace HTTP server (efficiency, extensibility). The "Simple 
  framework" http://www.simpleframework.org can be a good candidate. 
  Jetty may be a little complicated to set up?
  
* [C] Some touch screen awareness to make it just a little 
      usable for ipad, etc..?
      
      STARTED (1.0b6) - mapped some touch events to mouse events.
      Can now pan map and zoom via buttons on top, but this is 
      slow on Ipad. Zoom gesture does not work yet. 

* Allow a dynamic number of data channels to be configured. 
  Not just two. 

* Allow objects with certain attributes (like input channel, callsign) to 
  be visible only for logged in users. And/Or allow aliases, etc. 
  to be visible only for logged in users. SAR mode? 

* Change class hierarchy to support other types of position objects, 
  not just plain APRS. 
  
* Additions to search function?

* AIS objects and input channel.    
  
* Permissions (objects, other)? Sender id? Consider simple user profile support? 

* More configurable view profiles?  

* Consider per station logging to files? 

* More flexible logging?

* Side pane (stations, summary info)

 
 
 VERSION 2.0. M.0
 ----------------
 
 Use a database system for storing position/APRS data and try to 
 make the code more modular/extensible. 
  
 * Conceptual model
 * Revise class hierarchy. Focus on data. Make the switch to database easier. 
   Some changes may however wait until we move to database. 
 * Initial database schema.
 * Implementation. 
  
 * Consider web framework/http server like Lift or Servlets/JSP. Consider
   a more MVC based design.
