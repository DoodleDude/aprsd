V.1.7 (february 2014), etc
--------------------------
       
* [C] Filter profiles menu on client: Consider: Nested menu? Get list from server?

* [C] More configurable toolbar for iframe/mobile mode. 

* Selection of pre-defined region: Also select map-layer?
   
* Hiding of ident. Do it all on client. Hint from server. 
       
* Too easy to lock yourself out when changing admin-users regex. Workaround?
  Prevent removing of 'admin' user by plugin? 

* Activate/deactivate of channels at run-time. Re-load config. 

* [M] Better styling of forms for mobile. Consider JQuery mobile.

* [C] Extend iframeAPI ....
       IN PROGRESS

* [C] Move API code out from menu.js to api.js
       IN PROGRESS        

* Review how XML overlay works. Document it? Improvements? 
        
* Callback (API) to notify plugins about setting alias/icon.
        
* Dateline wrapping problems: 
   - Rubber zoom that crosses dateline results in trouble. 

* Document and simplify translation ?

* Consider moving country-specific (statkart, met.no, etc) stuff to separate plugin.

* Add copyright info for LocalePlanet stuff


   
Autorisation/Authentication
---------------------------

* How can we extend this in a plugin. 
      
* Extend login/user support. Individidual users + groups (roles) + permissions. 
  (maybe some of this should be implemented in db plugin, but need some
   core support here). 
  
* Re-consider SAR-mode. Allow multiple SAR-modes for different missions. 
  Assign users/groups/roles to SAR-missions. Configure SAR-missions like
  views to control how things are displayed (filters, etc). Consider assigning 
  aliases per SAR-mission instead of globally. Allow a SAR mode to activate 
  a particular (pre-defined) data source? 
  
       
      
Iframe/API
----------

* Consider how to add API extensions from plugins
* Add: Get trace from database
* Subscription: Info about a particular station/objects.
* Subscription: Misc. events from map view. 
* Consider security/login





Configuration support
---------------------
     
* Consider per-use reading of parameters
     
* Look at httpd/ServerBase.java: Can some config parameters be made static
  to reduce redundant storage when there are multiple instances? 

* Make channel classes and other relevant classes implement 
  ManagedObject interface. Support re-load without needing to 
  restart server.
    


    
Channels/Sources
----------------
     
* Channel code in separate subpackage / subdirectory: 
    - Move out Channel, InetChannel, TncChannel and DupCheck. 
    - Rename Channel to ChannelBase
    - Channel interface in core
    
* Flexible Gate for routing packets to and between channels? igate --> router
    - Router specification? Router framework?
    - Allow translation between protocols? Pluggable modules. 

* Soundmodem plugin
     STARTED. CANCELLED. Use extmodem instead.

* AIS plugin

* Receive positions from clients (mobile app). This is both a source and a web-service?
  Separate plugin? 
     STARTED
  
* [C] Elevation profile from kartverket WPS? 




Other. 
-----

* Import from GPX files (to layers?)

* App: Autodiscovery of servers on local network

* APRS messaging - a plugin? 

* Allow objects with certain attributes (like source, callsign) to 
  be visible only for logged in users. Note: Should this be part of a filter framework?
      IN PROGRESS

* Change class hierarchy to support other types of position objects, 
  not just plain APRS. 
      STARTED.
    
* Additions to search function?
