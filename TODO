Preparations for V.2.0 M.0

  Jetty may be a little complicated to set up?

  Not just two. 

* Allow objects with certain attributes (like input channel, callsign) to 
  be visible only for logged in users. And/Or allow aliases, etc. 
  to be visible only for logged in users. SAR mode? 

* Change class hierarchy to support other types of position objects, 
  not just plain APRS. 

* AIS objects and input channel.    
  
* Permissions (objects, other)? Sender id? Consider simple user profile support? 

* More configurable view profiles?  

* Consider per station logging to files? 

* More flexible logging?

 
 
 VERSION 2.0. M.0
 ----------------
 
 Use a database system for storing position/APRS data and try to 
 make the code more modular/extensible. 
  
 * Conceptual model
 * Revise class hierarchy. Focus on data. Make the switch to database easier. 
   Some changes may however wait until we move to database. 
 * Initial database schema.
 * Implementation. 
  
 * Consider web framework/http server like Lift or Servlets/JSP. Consider
   a more MVC based design.
